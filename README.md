# RUBY
The player begins in the center of the island, and from there must choose where to go from there by typing in directions. As the player explores the island, they must look around for trasures to sell to the merchant. Each time a treasure is picked up the player heads back to the island center to give them a chance to head into town and sell what they have to the merchant before the day finally ends and the fate of Ruby's dad is revealed based on the amount of money collected. Until the merchant is spoken to, the game gives the player a chance to cycle between locations to pick up treasure as much as they please until they see the merchant and find out if they've won or not.
